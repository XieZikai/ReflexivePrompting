1) my big fatggreek wedding - This option is not a clear wordplay either, as ""fatggreek"" doesn't form a recognizable word.

In this context, it sounds similar to ""wedding"", but implies the removal of an unwanted spouse, which is a humorous take on the original title.

3) my big fat greek wedading - This option is not a clear wordplay, as ""wedading"" is not a recognizable word.
